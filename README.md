## 🧭 What is the Radar Mod?

The **Radar Mod** is a cheat overlay that adds a compact radar to your HUD. It tracks and displays nearby:

* Enemy players & crews 👥
* Ships (sloops, brigs, galleons) 🚢
* Treasure items & loot piles 💰
* Skeletons, captains, sea forts ☠️
* Outpost & storm proximity 🌩️

The data is updated in real-time, giving you *complete spatial awareness* of your surroundings. It’s like having a god-tier crows’ nest vision 24/7.

## 🧠 Pirate Strategy with Radar

* Use short-range radar inside islands to detect tucker rats 🐀
* Set mid-range while sailing emissary routes to catch nearby ships 🚩
* Use long-range to avoid ambushes near turn-in outposts 🎒
* Combine with cannon aimbot for precision sea fights
* Activate ping alerts when going AFK or hiding loot

The radar isn’t just a map—it’s a *tactical advantage* no legit player has.

## ⚠️ Safety Tips

* Keep radar radius realistic (don’t scan across the map)
* Don’t spin in circles constantly tracking enemies — that’s a giveaway
* Disable radar when streaming or recording gameplay
* Use private loaders if possible (way less detectable)

Radar is usually low-risk, but overuse = suspicion = report = trouble. Play smart. 👀
